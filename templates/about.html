<p style =color:aliceblue>A web application designed to help healthcare professionals predict 
    and prevent Hepatitis infections. Our goal with this project is to 
    provide an accessible and accurate tool that can assist in identifying 
    potential cases of Hepatitis in patients.

    The Hepatitis Prediction System was developed for diagnosis and treatment.
    We recognized the need for a reliable and efficient tool to predict Hepatitis
    infections and decided to take on the challenge.
    Our system uses advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques
    to analyze patient data and provide predictions on the likelihood of Hepatitis
    infection. We believe that this technology can help healthcare professionals make
    more informed decisions about patient care, leading to improved health outcomes 
    for individuals and communities.
